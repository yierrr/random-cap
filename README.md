# random-capitalize

*I wrote this while waiting for my friend at a mall so nothing serious here*

This boring piece of code turns normal sentences into ones with randomized captialized or lower-cased letters that make no sense (e.g. 'chemtrails over the country club' to 'chEMtrAILs oVEr thE countRY cLub'). Inspired by a student campaign poster seen in Notts and my friend's following comment that such form is only used for ridicule in her country.
